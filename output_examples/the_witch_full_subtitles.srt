1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,206
(music, music mood, scary music)

2
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:25,927
Today, you are truly blessed.

3
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:30,388
Today, you fight for God himself.

4
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:36,471
Today, you are holy warriors baptized in the blood of our unholy enemies.

5
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:40,492
Look at that rabble down there, Bayman, just waiting to meet the Lord.

6
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:44,253
I pity any man whose last face they see is yours, Felson.

7
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:45,574
...has fallen.

8
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:51,216
The only sin you will face this day is failure.

9
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,477
Whoever slays the most men drinks for free.

10
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:54,189
(non-motorized land vehicle, bicycle, sounds of things, vehicle)

11
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:56,810
I'll take the 300 on the left, you take the 300 on the right.

12
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,912
But if we divide them evenly, who will buy tonight's drinks?

13
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,233
Oh, you're buying, my friend.

14
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:04,834
Prepare for battle!

15
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:05,655
Fine.

16
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:06,435
I'll kill all 600 myself.

17
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:40,145
(tools, sawing, sounds of things, wood)

18
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:40,525
No!

19
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:40,665
No!

20
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:40,846
No!

21
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:41,186
No!

22
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:41,426
No!

23
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:41,626
No!

24
00:01:54,497 --> 00:02:08,507
(music, glass, shatter, human voice, speech)

25
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,051
I'm building up a powerful search, baby!

26
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,314
You're fine, my friend.

27
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:29,582
(music, glass, shatter)

28
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:32,043
The spell-break will blind your paradise!

29
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:34,525
Ride down for unholy enemies!

30
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:59,292
(tools, sawing, surface contact, rub, sounds of things, wood)

31
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:24,585
I will not yield until every enemy of God has fallen!

32
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:27,126
You ever get the feeling God has too many enemies?

33
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,626
(miscellaneous sources, arrow)

34
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,608
Being his friend is not so easy either!

35
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,662
They are godless people!

36
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:49,924
Infidels!

37
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:54,747
They have sinned against God and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

38
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:56,849
They must be punished!

39
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,780
(tools, jackhammer)

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,081
Do not fail him!

41
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:03,223
Strike down with his vengeance!

42
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:07,686
Let none survive!

43
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:59,070
(truck, air brake)

44
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:12,018
A thousand lost souls for the fires of hell.

45
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,119
A glorious day for the church.

46
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,500
You call this glorious?

47
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,641
Murdering women and children?

48
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:19,803
Know your place, knight.

49
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,484
You pledge your life to the cause.

50
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:23,305
For God.

51
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,138
(source-ambiguous sounds, silence)

52
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:24,738
Not for this.

53
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,480
I am the herald of God in this world.

54
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,662
His voice rings ever in my ears.

55
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,663
Perhaps it is not his voice you hear.

56
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:32,664
How dare you!

57
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:37,628
I am the voice of the church, bathed in truth and blameless in the light of my Lord.

58
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,309
You are no more than a rogue with blood on his hands.

59
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,372
Who controls your insolent tongue, Bayman?

60
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:54,053
(music, music mood, happy music)

61
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,214
Let's get the hell out of here.

62
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,620
You cannot leave.

63
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:03,803
Who's going to stop us?

64
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:31,988
(music, music mood, sad music)

65
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,292
Sheep roaming free and no shepherd in sight.

66
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:44,192
Did they jump the fence?

67
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,013
All of them.

68
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,715
We've been walking all day and haven't passed the soul.

69
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:54,096
Keep your souls.

70
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:55,036
Let me find a chicken.

71
00:06:55,316 --> 00:07:21,903
(arrow, human locomotion, run, human voice, speech, animal)

72
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:22,604
Is anyone here?

73
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:27,488
Hello?

74
00:07:37,176 --> 00:08:45,282
(non-motorized land vehicle, skateboard)

75
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:48,963
I haven't seen much death, you and I. Some deserved, some not.

76
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,763
But what does one do to deserve a death like that?

77
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:53,404
Nothing.

78
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,527
Finally, a town.

79
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:10,867
We might be recognized.

80
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,302
(clock, clicking, tick)

81
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:14,302
We should go around them.

82
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:15,483
Go where?

83
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,504
These horses won't carry us.

84
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:19,985
They're farm animals.

85
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,827
We need proper horses, food, provisions.

86
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:38,626
(music, human locomotion, shuffle, human voice, speech)

87
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,215
Please let them come to me!

88
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:43,077
I beg you!

89
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:43,237
Me!

90
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:43,518
Me!

91
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:43,658
Me!

92
00:09:47,688 --> 00:10:00,034
(specific impact sounds, basketball bounce)
