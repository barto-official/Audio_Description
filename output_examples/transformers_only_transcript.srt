1
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:19,983
Marvelous Skook!

2
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:20,884
It's Unicron!

3
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,702
The ships!

4
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:57,886
Get to the ships!

5
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:59,492
It's our only chance!

6
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:26,352
Hi.

7
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,297
Transformers!

8
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:02,097
Transformers!

9
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:04,117
Oh, the beastly eyes!

10
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:04,818
Transformers!

11
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:06,498
Robots in disguise!

12
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:07,418
Transformers!

13
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,839
All of us wage their battle to destroy the evil forces!

14
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,180
Oh, goodness has it come!

15
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:10,724
It is the year 2005.

16
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:17,446
The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron.

17
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:31,271
But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons, the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.

18
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,805
Ironhide, report to me at once.

19
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:51,547
Every time I look into a monitor prime, my circuits sizzle.

20
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:55,747
When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops?

21
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:59,888
I want you to make a special run to Autobot City on Earth.

22
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:06,410
But... Listen, Ironhide, we don't have enough energon cubes to power a full-scale assault.

23
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,910
Ready the shuttle for launch.

24
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,151
Your days are numbered now, Deceptichreeks.

25
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,170
Report security status.

26
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,374
No sign of Decepticons here, Prime!

27
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:26,536
What about Moonbase 2?

28
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:28,880
Jazz to Moonbase 2!

29
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,524
Jazz to Moonbase 2!

30
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,222
Bumblebee and Spike here.

31
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,403
We're about to send up with Shadow.

32
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:39,024
Isn't he set to count shenanigans in your area?

33
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:40,444
All clear, Jazz.

34
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,746
Hey, Ironhide, tell my son Daniel I miss him.

35
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,467
And tell him not to worry.

36
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:49,989
I'll be coming home as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail across the galaxy.

37
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:51,870
Will do, Spike.

38
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,851
Cliffjumper, commence countdown.

39
00:05:55,832 --> 00:06:00,394
Five, four, three, two, one.

40
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:12,771
Now, all we need is a little energon and a lot of luck.

41
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:25,087
Laserbeak returns, Megatron.

42
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:26,668
Welcome, Laserbeak.

43
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:31,391
Unlike some of my other warriors, you never fail me.

44
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:36,275
Soundwave, playback Laserbeak's findings.

45
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:38,697
As you command, Megatron.

46
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,018
I want you to make a special run to Autobot City on Earth.

47
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,461
Listen, Ironhide.

48
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:52,525
We don't have enough energon cubes to power a full-scale assault.

49
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,007
Ready the shuttle for launch.

50
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:59,771
Now all we need is a little energon and a lot of luck.

51
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:03,215
More than you imagine, Optimus Prime.

52
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,220
The Megatron is simply gone!

53
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,641
Die, Autobot!

54
00:07:59,365 --> 00:07:59,747
I love you.

55
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:05,005
This was almost too easy, Starscream!

56
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:13,352
Much easier, almighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat, the Autobots' moon base!

57
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,814
You're an idiot, Starscream!

58
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:25,201
When we slip by their early warning systems in their own shuttle and destroy Autobot City, the Autobots will be vanquished forever!

59
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:26,662
No!

60
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,905
Such heroic nonsense!

61
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:44,254
Fish are jumping today, huh, Danno?

62
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:45,855
I guess so.

63
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,537
Hey, what's the matter?

64
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,778
Uh, I don't know, Hot Rod.

65
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,161
Come on, you can tell me.

66
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,403
Guess I just miss my dad.

67
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,464
Don't worry, Spike will be back soon.

68
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,506
Oh, hey, I caught something!

69
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,270
Whoa, look at the size of it!

70
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,052
Yep, it's a whopper, all right.

71
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,711
Hot Rod, the shuttle's coming.

72
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:16,792
Let's watch it land.

73
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:19,352
Talk about dull, Daniel.

74
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:30,995
Where are we or what is it?

75
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,282
If you're gonna ride, Danno, ride in style!

76
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:53,646
Hey, let's stop here!

77
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,248
Why settle for a peak, Daniel, when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain?

78
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,410
A little gentle left, a little bit more.

79
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,680
Terrible revenue, punk.

80
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:16,442
I'll straighten you out yet.

81
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,043
Hot Rod, look!

82
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:22,027
There's a hole in the shuttle!

83
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:22,187
What?

84
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,048
Decepticons!

85
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:44,659
What's that fool doing?

86
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:44,859
Attack!

87
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:45,180
Daniel!

88
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,917
Not bad for an old-timer.

89
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,359
Old-timer?

90
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,864
That's something you'll never believe if you don't get back to the city.

91
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:43,805
Save it, cop!

92
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:16,347
Ultra Magnus, a customary evaluation of Decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficiency.

93
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:19,554
In other words, Perceptor, we're outnumbered.

94
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,204
Pranger, you and R.C.

95
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,504
transform Autobot City.

96
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:32,086
Perceptor, tell Blaster to radio prime for reinforcements.

97
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,086
What about me, Magnus?

98
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:33,506
What about me?

99
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,226
I can help.

100
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:34,867
I want to help.

101
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,387
What about me?

102
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,408
Blur, you can help me alert the others.

103
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:38,808
Absolutely, positively, definitely.

104
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:39,989
Nobody gets job done faster than I can.

105
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,829
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

106
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:43,110
Come on, R.C., let's go.

107
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,111
But Hot Rod and Copper are still outside the city.

108
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:50,313
We can't wait.

109
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,054
They'll have to take care of themselves.

110
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:52,754
Come on.

111
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:16,482
Ascetic fools!

112
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,447
There's no escape!

113
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:12,761
They're a little heavier than the electrons, Electron!

114
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:16,302
The Insecticons are in our way!

115
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:16,682
Wrong!

116
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:17,703
They're our way in!

117
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:56,509
shake it under the next fortress blaster ultra magnus sends orders to contact optimus prime on moon base one all right cover your receptors perceptor

118
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:05,225
Optimus Prime, do you read me?

119
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:09,788
The Decepticons of Blitzing Autobot City, we're really taking a pounding.

120
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:12,350
Don't know how much longer we can hold out.

121
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,293
Soundwave, jam that transmission.

122
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:26,041
Rumble Frenzy, Ravage Ratbat, Eject Operation Interference.

123
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:28,423
Optimus Prime, do you read me?

124
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:32,367
The Decepticons of Blitzing Autobot City, we're really taking...

125
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:39,128
First we crack the shell, then we crack the nuts inside!

126
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:47,696
Hey!

127
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:48,938
Run, Blaster!

128
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:50,339
Save yourself!

129
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,600
No way!

130
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,581
Two can play!

131
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,692
Do you think you got through to Prime?

132
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:16,576
Let's hope so, because if I didn't, we're all gonna look like burnt-out toaster ovens.

133
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,583
We've got Decepticons in the gates, Decepticons in the air, Decepticons inside the walls, Decepticons, Decepticons, Decepticons.

134
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:25,744
If we beat them off the walls, initial on the air.

135
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:26,945
If we shoot them out of the air, the initial of the gates.

136
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:27,565
So where does that lead us?

137
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:28,146
Nowhere, that's where.

138
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,220
Come on, RC.

139
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:46,241
We gotta get this launcher into place.

140
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:50,863
Megatron's making his big push, and we gotta push back.

141
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:54,865
Keep at it, springer-boy.

142
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:55,905
Helps the hand.

143
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,566
Together now.

144
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,861
I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city.

145
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,343
Hey, I wasn't worried for a microsecond.

146
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:15,944
Then you probably didn't understand the situation.

147
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:20,666
I did it.

148
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:29,150
Constructicons, merge for the kill!

149
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,751
Pop, Hot Rod, look!

150
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,160
and die.

151
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,339
Their defenses are broken!

152
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,844
Let the slaughter begin!

153
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,588
Dinobots, destroy Devastator!

154
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,811
Me Grimlock love challenge!

155
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:55,737
Dinobots, transform!

156
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:26,051
Megatron must be stopped, no matter the cost.

157
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:20,063
One shall stand, one shall fall.

158
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,385
Why throw away your life so recklessly?

159
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:26,907
That's a question you should ask yourself, Megatron.

160
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:28,207
No!

161
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:31,129
I'll crush you with my bare hands!

162
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,851
I've got Te-El Prime!

163
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:37,272
Stay away, lad!

164
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:38,773
That's Prime's fight!

165
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:27,420
You got the power!

166
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:30,424
Finish him off, Brian!

167
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:31,345
Do it now!

168
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:59,252
no more optimus prime grab me mercy i beg of you you who are without mercy now plead for it i thought you were made of sterner stuff no you don't megatron out of the way hot rod

169
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,331
I would have waited an eternity for this.

170
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,913
It's over, Prime.

171
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,608
Optimus, forgive me.

172
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:51,052
How do you feel, mighty Megatron?

173
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:57,582
Astrokane, transform and get us out of here!

174
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:01,067
Don't leave me, Soundwave.

175
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,561
The Decepticons are retreating!

176
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:24,842
Time did it!

177
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:26,302
Get your in the dive!

178
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:27,463
Astrotrain!

179
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:27,903
Take off!

180
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,128
I fear the wolves are fatal.

181
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,357
Prime, you can't die!

182
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,000
Do not grieve.

183
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:26,145
Soon, I shall be one with the Matrix.

184
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:37,040
Ultra Magnus, it is to you, old friend.

185
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:43,965
I shall pass the Matrix of Leadership as it was passed to me.

186
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:47,787
But Prime, I'm... I'm just a soldier.

187
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,808
I... I'm not worthy.

188
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,974
Nor was I. But one day, an Autobot shall rise from our ranks.

189
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:06,991
darkest hour.

190
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:55,753
you

191
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:55,441
Jettison some weight, or I'll never make it to Cybertron!

192
00:26:55,862 --> 00:27:02,728
Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden.

193
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:07,545
In that case, I say it is survival of the fittest!

194
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:09,766
Do I hear a second on that?

195
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:11,006
Aye!

196
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,126
And against?

197
00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:14,647
Nay!

198
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,187
The ayes have it!

199
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:19,588
Get!

200
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:21,889
Make room for others!

201
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,951
Oh, how it pains me to do this!

202
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:34,977
Wait, I still function.

203
00:27:34,997 --> 00:27:36,680
Wanna bet?

204
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:42,751
Stare!

205
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:44,173
Where?

206
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:54,169
As Megatron has, how shall we say, departed, I nominate myself as the new leader!

207
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:54,709
Wait!

208
00:27:54,949 --> 00:28:00,350
The Constructicons form Devastator, the most powerful robot we should rule!

209
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:02,431
Soundwave's superior.

210
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,791
Constructicons inferior.

211
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:07,032
Who are you calling inferior?

212
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:10,555
Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you!

213
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:14,118
Hey, nobody calls soundwave uncrasmatic!

214
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,239
Yeah, let's kick tailgate!

215
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,461
Constructicons, unite!

216
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:57,369
Megatron... Welcome, Megatron.

217
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:22,378
Show yourself.

218
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,722
I have summoned you here for a purpose.

219
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:30,128
Nobody summons Megatron.

220
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,452
Then it pleases me to be the first.

221
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:39,253
is my command.

222
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:44,034
You are to destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.

223
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:51,616
It is the one thing, the only thing, that can stand in my way.

224
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:54,337
You have nothing to fear.

225
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:59,118
I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.

226
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:00,859
You exaggerate.

227
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:05,300
The point is he's dead, and the Matrix died with him.

228
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,519
Point is, you are a fool.

229
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:15,544
The Matrix has been passed to their new leader, Ultra Magnus.

230
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:17,946
Destroy it for me.

231
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:19,287
Why should I?

232
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:20,968
What's in it for me?

233
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:26,313
Your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well.

234
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:31,657
I will provide you with a new body and new troops to command.

235
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:32,478
And?

236
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:33,579
And nothing.

237
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,606
You belong to me now.

238
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,406
I belong to nobody!

239
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,307
Perhaps I misjudged you.

240
00:30:44,868 --> 00:30:50,770
Proceed on your way to oblivion.

241
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,030
No!

242
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:51,570
No!

243
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,870
I accept your terms!

244
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:58,812
I accept!

245
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:01,493
Excellent.

246
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:24,226
Behold, Galvatron.

247
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:28,148
And these shall be your minions.

248
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,711
Scourge, the tracker.

249
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:39,054
And his husband, the sweeps.

250
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:48,259
Cyclonus, the warrior and his armada.

251
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,961
And this shall be

252
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:07,893
Autobot Matrix will rip open Ultra Magnus and every other Autobot until the Matrix has been destroyed.

253
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:13,757
To Cybertron!

254
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,406
Destroy the Matrix.

255
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,061
Get on with the ceremony.

256
00:32:54,368 --> 00:33:05,695
My fellow Decepticons, as your new leader, I... Who disrupts my coronation?

257
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:10,140
Coronation Starscream?

258
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,321
This is bad comedy.

259
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:13,482
Megatron?

260
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:14,663
Is that you?

261
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:15,584
Here's a hint.

262
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:45,496
Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes?

263
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:48,397
What'd he say his name was?

264
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,879
Galvatron.

265
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,641
What is Galvatron?

266
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,522
Galvatron!

267
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:07,888
Where'd that come from?

268
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:11,766
Who cares?

269
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:13,888
I'm more worried about where it's going.

270
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:19,914
Talk to me, Earth.

271
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,796
We got a situation out here.

272
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,525
Roger me, Wilco me, anything.

273
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,706
Hello, hello, Earth.

274
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:33,528
I'm picking up a fake signal.

275
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:40,893
This is Jazz, a ginormous, weird-looking planet that showed up in the suburbs of Cybertron.

276
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:43,395
And it's attacking Moonbase 1.

277
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:45,696
Charles, press jumper.

278
00:34:55,822 --> 00:34:58,123
Got the blast free, if we can.

279
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:00,765
Ignition and hit it!

280
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:16,596
This is Spike and Bumblebee up here on moon base two.

281
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:21,638
This thing, this monster planet just ripped the first moon to shreds.

282
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,259
And it's heading this way.

283
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,180
We'll try and slow it down.

284
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,402
But you'd better get here fast because we're not gonna... Dad!

285
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,884
Bumblebee, activate the explosives.

286
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:37,405
If this doesn't stop at nothing, Will.

287
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:38,906
The explosives are activated.

288
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:40,427
Let's get out of here.

289
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,024
Way to go!

290
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:14,285
Look!

291
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:16,086
It isn't even dented!

292
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:22,109
Oh shit, what are we gonna do now?

293
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:24,430
We're being sucked into it!

294
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:28,233
How dare Unicron!

295
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,855
Cybertron and all his moons belong to me!

296
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:41,907
But remember, we belong to him.

297
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:44,689
I belong to nobody!

298
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:49,292
I will obey Unicron!

299
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:52,154
Decepticons to Earth!

300
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,329
Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles.

301
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:11,211
This new menace is more dangerous than all the Decepticons put together.

302
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:14,993
Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron.

303
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,473
But what about my dad?

304
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:20,695
He's on the moon between that monster planet and Cybertron.

305
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:24,097
Daniel, we'll do everything we can for Spike.

306
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:26,175
And what are we gonna do when we get there?

307
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:29,158
If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us.

308
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,319
Maybe the Matrix can stop it.

309
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,581
You're right, it can.

310
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,262
What do you know about it, lad?

311
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:35,983
I just got this feeling.

312
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:37,765
Look!

313
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,969
Another shot of us.

314
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:50,195
I, Galvatron, will crush you just as Megatron crushed Prime.

315
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:54,410
And you'll die trying, just like Megatron.

316
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:57,512
Autobot scrap!

317
00:37:58,073 --> 00:38:00,274
You want me to gut Ultra Magnus?

318
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,255
There are plenty of Autobots for you.

319
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,797
Ultra Magnus is mine!

320
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:11,561
Stay close to me, Daniel!

321
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:13,522
And you better stay close to me!

322
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,094
No, you'd better stay close to me.

323
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:22,315
Nice dino, good dino, sweet dino.

324
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:23,516
Won't you step into the nice base here for blood?

325
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:24,537
Pretty please, pretty, pretty, pretty please.

326
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:26,498
Nice dino, good dino, with sugar on top and a cherry and some whipped cream.

327
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:27,719
Nice dino, good dino, sweet dino.

328
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,981
Me Grimlock not nice dino.

329
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,503
Me best brains.

330
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,732
Blur, get the Dinobots in the shuttle!

331
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:57,475
I'm trying to get them into the shuttle, Ultra Magnus, because I know he can't launch the shuttle until I get them into the shuttle, but I can't seem to get them into the shuttle because they're impossible, impossible, impossible!

332
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:58,616
Okay, forget it.

333
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:02,298
Cup, Hot Rod, you guys get the Dinobots aboard and get out of here!

334
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:15,085
Come on, you big bozo, get in the shuttle!

335
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:27,979
This reminds me of the battle on Alpha-9, the Petro-Rabbits with... Grimlock, get your noodle out of my face!

336
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:32,342
Me Grimlock love cops' war stories!

337
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:34,084
You're living one now!

338
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:37,166
Engage the boosters, for Cybertron's sake!

339
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:41,270
Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits again!

340
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,472
I'll give you Petro-Rabbits!

341
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:44,613
Contact!

342
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:58,049
Looks like we're shipmates, Squirt.

343
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,351
All right!

344
00:40:00,151 --> 00:40:04,276
But if you get space sick, you're gonna walk home.

345
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:04,476
Hurry!

346
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:05,898
Wait, Ultra Magnus!

347
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:06,879
Our sea's still out there!

348
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:36,066
Thanks.

349
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,367
That was close.

350
00:40:39,768 --> 00:40:41,848
Believe it or not, this is the fun part.

351
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:58,855
Congratulations, Autobots.

352
00:40:58,895 --> 00:40:59,535
We've lost them.

353
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:01,156
So rest while you can.

354
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:09,303
Yep, I remember the dust was so thick off Beta-4, you had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors.

355
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:12,465
Me Grimlock know all about wipers.

356
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:14,766
Want to hear good part of story?

357
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:16,627
Good part, cop.

358
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,388
Tell Swoop good part.

359
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:19,989
Okay, okay.

360
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:22,757
Well, the dust was really thick.

361
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:31,742
And then this gigantic ickyak came trumping and stomping down the mountain, flames spewing out of its nostrils.

362
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:37,686
And I thought for sure... Hey, cop, don't you think we have better things to do now than tell old stories?

363
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:38,826
Like what?

364
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:43,729
Like maybe figure out how we're gonna rescue our friends and then save Cybertron.

365
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:44,430
No!

366
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,530
Tell story!

367
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:47,191
Shh!

368
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:47,491
Quiet!

369
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:48,092
Tell story!

370
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:48,552
We want to hear it!

371
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,215
They're closing on us.

372
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:09,777
Yep, like the strike bats of Dramadon.

373
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:11,017
How'd you beat them?

374
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:12,478
I'm trying to remember.

375
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:14,859
There were an awful lot of casualties that day.

376
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,060
Oh, yeah, we invented polarities.

377
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:20,841
They're coming back!

378
00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:30,005
Oh, right, we survived that.

379
00:42:30,265 --> 00:42:31,986
Yeah, but boys survive this.

380
00:42:37,113 --> 00:42:39,515
Cyclonus, transform and attack!

381
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:42,337
I can't control it!

382
00:43:12,062 --> 00:43:13,783
Cop and Hot Rod just bought it.

383
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,884
I can't deal with that now.

384
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,168
Face it, Magnus.

385
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:24,270
The Decepticons are gonna dog us until they see us dead.

386
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,092
Then that's exactly what they're gonna see.

387
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,553
Prepare for emergency separation.

388
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:30,674
That's too dangerous.

389
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:31,935
What choice do we have?

390
00:44:02,028 --> 00:44:04,311
The Autobots have been terminated.

391
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:05,492
Excellent.

392
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:08,255
And the Matrix with them.

393
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:11,098
No!

394
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:12,820
Unicrons!

395
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:13,981
Why?

396
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:16,464
Take me to Unicron!

397
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:17,725
Take me now!

398
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:35,486
Did we have to let him detonate three quarters of the ship?

399
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:40,189
Seeing as how they would have detonated four quarters, I think it was a good choice.

400
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,631
But now how are we gonna get there in this wreck?

401
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:46,154
Perceptor, can you locate a place to set down for repairs?

402
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:50,337
Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities.

403
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:54,980
However... Yes, I believe I can.

404
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,122
The planet of junk is in this vicinity.

405
00:44:57,342 --> 00:44:58,503
Then let's go for it.

406
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:12,121
Cup!

407
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:13,661
Grimlock!

408
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:15,102
Slam!

409
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,482
Anybody!

410
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:51,511
God!

411
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:51,631
No!

412
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:27,264
Cup.

413
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:27,865
Talk to me.

414
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:28,265
Fix me.

415
00:46:28,305 --> 00:46:28,665
Sure, Cup.

416
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:29,366
Right away.

417
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,973
Race for impact!

418
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:39,669
Say something.

419
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:41,570
Anybody.

420
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:47,716
Remind me to give the autopilot a raise.

421
00:47:48,357 --> 00:47:48,857
Daniel?

422
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:51,960
I'm okay.

423
00:47:55,523 --> 00:47:57,185
Let's try to salvage this thing.

424
00:47:57,685 --> 00:47:58,446
Can I help too?

425
00:47:59,427 --> 00:48:00,548
It's rough out there, kid.

426
00:48:01,747 --> 00:48:04,248
I think Daniel can make himself useful with this.

427
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:06,428
It was Spike's exosuit.

428
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:07,769
Dad's exosuit.

429
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:09,229
He told me all about it.

430
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:10,610
Here, try it on.

431
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:17,472
Now try to walk.

432
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:18,752
Come on, you can do it.

433
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:31,075
Just think about what you want to do before you do it.

434
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:33,196
It's kind of tricky.

435
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:34,637
Whoa!

436
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:39,240
Keep on practicing.

437
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,360
You'll get the hang of it.

438
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,021
Come on, showtime's over.

439
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:43,082
We've got work to do.

440
00:48:55,009 --> 00:48:57,831
This must be the junk capital of the universe.

441
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:08,950
Stop the no-welcome wagonello stranger with that good coffee flavor for you.

442
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,951
Well, you know, I want money back.

443
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:13,872
Offer expires while you wait.

444
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:16,332
Operators are standing by.

445
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:25,314
That does it.

446
00:49:26,315 --> 00:49:26,995
Well, what do you think?

447
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:40,997
Of all the circuit glitch die-out blowin' them wittery, you left a piece out!

448
00:49:41,477 --> 00:49:42,118
No way!

449
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:43,239
You're just a little stiff.

450
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,202
Anyway, all things considered, you did an amazing job, lad.

451
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:48,524
Amazing.

452
00:49:49,304 --> 00:49:49,625
Really?

453
00:49:50,185 --> 00:49:53,228
Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty bar on my rotator.

454
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:57,192
Now let's find the Dinobots and get off this twisted planet.

455
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:16,711
Don't act hostile.

456
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:18,932
I'll use the universal greeting.

457
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,933
Universal greeting?

458
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:21,713
Watch.

459
00:50:22,213 --> 00:50:34,617
I'll have an idiot out of my hand.

460
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:35,698
See?

461
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:38,138
The universal greeting works every time.

462
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:40,819
Not without making any sudden moves.

463
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:42,780
Offer them an energy on goody.

464
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,281
This is getting expensive.

465
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:51,604
Don't worry, they'll reciprocate.

466
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:56,087
I thought they were supposed to reciprocate.

467
00:50:56,107 --> 00:50:56,747
No more.

468
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:56,968
Empty.

469
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:24,373
Reminds me of the Knight of Slave Mind on Galganath VII.

470
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:26,755
Every place reminds you of someplace else.

471
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:28,216
Experience, lad.

472
00:51:28,236 --> 00:51:29,656
You should learn to appreciate it.

473
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,477
A lot of good it's done us so far.

474
00:51:31,898 --> 00:51:34,019
Hey, what's going on over there?

475
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:38,842
Has the Imperial Magistrate reached a verdict?

476
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:41,483
I have.

477
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:44,185
Guilty or innocent?

478
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:45,646
Innocent.

479
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:48,268
Feed him to the Sharkticons.

480
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:11,053
What is this place?

481
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:18,580
The world of the savage-shocked icons and their cruel masters, the Quintessons.

482
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:20,802
I am Grannix.

483
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:23,805
My planet was destroyed by Unicron.

484
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:24,886
Unicron?

485
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,408
Who's Unicron?

486
00:52:26,888 --> 00:52:31,112
A planet that devours everything in its path.

487
00:52:31,553 --> 00:52:33,094
So that's the monster's name.

488
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:38,413
Oh, please!

489
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:42,704
I'm the last survivor of LIF!

490
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:44,207
No!

491
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:45,110
No!

492
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,012
Let him go!

493
00:52:55,607 --> 00:53:10,947
majestic reached a verdict I have guilty or innocent justice I repeat guilty or innocent

494
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:40,041
At the end, I'd wish for that.

495
00:53:41,082 --> 00:53:42,523
Me, Swoop, no see nothing.

496
00:53:43,023 --> 00:53:47,325
Me, dreamlock, positive, hot rod and cop clothes.

497
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:51,367
Me, slag, say you full of the really and the lonely.

498
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,902
Me Grimlock say you full of cesium salami.

499
00:53:57,922 --> 00:54:00,103
Oh, really, I'm bologna.

500
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:03,225
Primfine, look behind.

501
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:05,086
Who say that?

502
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:14,712
Primfine, look behind.

503
00:54:15,153 --> 00:54:17,454
You go wrong way, you fool, I say.

504
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,715
Me Grimlock fool.

505
00:54:20,316 --> 00:54:22,517
Picture you got, no fool you not.

506
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:39,106
Why boy hid my nose?

507
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:41,787
Really saved my friends today.

508
00:54:43,087 --> 00:54:45,448
Me Grimlock say we on our way.

509
00:54:52,731 --> 00:55:02,154
Eurythron!

510
00:55:02,694 --> 00:55:04,235
Why did you torture me?

511
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:08,326
No, Unicron!

512
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:13,528
Ultra Magnus is dead, and the Matrix destroyed!

513
00:55:14,288 --> 00:55:18,029
The Matrix has not been destroyed.

514
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:23,532
And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk.

515
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:25,592
Stock him.

516
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:27,773
Tear him apart.

517
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:31,555
And destroy the Matrix.

518
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:39,980
Be sure the fittings are securely welded.

519
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,300
Absolutely, positively, definitely.

520
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,680
I wouldn't do it any other way, any other way at all.

521
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:45,901
Whoa, this exosuit's fantastic.

522
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:47,942
I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.

523
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:52,263
Forward!

524
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:54,303
Aventi and I go for the gospel.

525
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:00,985
Decepticons.

526
00:56:01,345 --> 00:56:03,446
We've got to draw them off and double back to the shuttle.

527
00:56:17,827 --> 00:56:18,948
There goes the shuttle!

528
00:56:19,148 --> 00:56:20,468
What do I do?

529
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:23,270
Transform!

530
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,930
Transform!

531
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:25,691
You can do it!

532
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:28,892
I know you can do it!

533
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:30,333
You can do it!

534
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:34,455
Transform!

535
00:56:40,478 --> 00:56:42,179
Human germ!

536
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:43,900
Transform!

537
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:53,287
There they are!

538
00:56:54,087 --> 00:56:54,648
Attack!

539
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:04,075
Make a break for cover.

540
00:57:04,195 --> 00:57:06,057
I'll try to unleash the power of the Matrix.

541
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,260
Kill all our one!

542
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:14,163
Kill all our one!

543
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:33,592
Prime, you said the Matrix would light our darkest hour.

544
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:35,053
Magnus!

545
00:57:36,313 --> 00:57:37,614
I want the Matrix!

546
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:38,775
Never!

547
00:57:39,396 --> 00:57:41,137
We exterminate him!

548
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:48,622
Die!

549
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:50,783
Die!

550
00:57:54,886 --> 00:57:57,028
Unicron, my master.

551
00:57:58,163 --> 00:58:02,365
With this, I shall make you my slave.

552
00:58:06,647 --> 00:58:12,250
Before his Imperial Majesty delivers a verdict, would you like to beg for your lives?

553
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,632
It sometimes helps, but not often.

554
00:58:16,652 --> 00:58:19,514
I can't transform.

555
00:58:20,114 --> 00:58:20,974
Keep trying.

556
00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:24,456
Silence, or you'll be held in contempt of this court.

557
00:58:24,736 --> 00:58:27,038
I have nothing but contempt for this court.

558
00:58:31,235 --> 00:58:31,796
Innocent.

559
00:58:38,442 --> 00:58:41,646
They've got more sharkticons than we have photon charges.

560
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:43,648
Then let's hold a demolition, Davey.

561
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:38,937
Didn't even bend a fender.

562
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:43,199
Yeah, but look, there are a lot more of those can-digging, grill-cracking things.

563
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:53,522
We can't hold out forever, Cup, but we can give them one humongous repair bill.

564
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:22,289
Excuse me!

565
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:27,073
Me Grimlock want to munch battle!

566
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:57,777
I never thought I'd be so happy to see those big bozos.

567
01:00:58,317 --> 01:01:01,218
Me Grimlock no bozo, me king!

568
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,099
Shark dekons, execute them!

569
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,861
Me Grimlock say execute them!

570
01:01:19,383 --> 01:01:23,024
I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly.

571
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,502
Yeah, but what about our problems?

572
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:26,623
We need a ship.

573
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:28,826
You get ship if I get trip.

574
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:29,887
Who are you?

575
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:31,289
Him wheelie.

576
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,551
Him friend.

577
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:36,134
He'll be mine, too, if he can find a ship.

578
01:01:36,435 --> 01:01:38,257
Gibster, over there.

579
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:40,379
That's a ship.

580
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:42,381
Who cares?

581
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:43,403
As long as it flies.

582
01:01:56,512 --> 01:02:11,867
without the matrix there is no hope no hope no hope no hope at all first prime now ultra magnus what do we do look don't look behind door number two monkey it's time to play end of the line my valentine

583
01:02:30,212 --> 01:02:33,594
It's not hard to knock them down it's getting them to stay

584
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:05,358
You check in, but you don't check out.

585
01:03:05,398 --> 01:03:08,558
You better squeeze all the time when you can.

586
01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:09,759
But Mr. Whipple's not around.

587
01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:13,120
Put your head in the microwave and get yourself a can.

588
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,400
Take some wooden nickels.

589
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,560
Look, there's a gun.

590
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:06,122
I'll tell you as she goes, Bob.

591
01:04:06,182 --> 01:04:08,383
Snoopy visitors get mad in the eye by and by.

592
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:09,363
Film at 11.

593
01:04:16,827 --> 01:04:17,887
It's Hot Rod!

594
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:19,788
And Cupin the Dinobot!

595
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,651
Guns aren't exactly friendly.

596
01:04:25,191 --> 01:04:27,232
Neither are they, in case you haven't noticed.

597
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:29,713
What was that universal greeting again?

598
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:30,414
Never mind.

599
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:30,994
I remember.

600
01:04:31,806 --> 01:04:47,617
Baweep grana weep ninny bong Baweep grana weep ninny bong Baweep grana weep ninny bong Baweep grana weep ninny bong Baweep grana weep ninny bong

601
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,222
Tell me one last thing.

602
01:04:58,322 --> 01:04:59,523
It's all right.

603
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:04,106
We can be super long and light.

604
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:06,768
Come on, join the crowd.

605
01:05:06,808 --> 01:05:09,749
Shout it out loud.

606
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,292
Me Grimlock not kiss her.

607
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:15,133
Me Grimlock King.

608
01:05:15,153 --> 01:05:21,137
Have a nice day and please pose comfortably for striking, friends.

609
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:24,719
We fit for rooty soul, say the champions.

610
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,991
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

611
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:28,633
TV.

612
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:30,234
We talk TV.

613
01:05:30,554 --> 01:05:31,655
You talk some TV.

614
01:05:31,855 --> 01:05:32,956
I talk some TV.

615
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:34,337
And now the news.

616
01:05:34,437 --> 01:05:35,578
Don't touch that dial.

617
01:05:35,658 --> 01:05:37,820
Now we run away.

618
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:43,104
My George Kemosabe's your smashed up friend soon like brand new with 90 day warranty.

619
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,555
Happy birthday!

620
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:57,876
Happy birthday!

621
01:06:00,597 --> 01:06:04,358
Look, he's alive!

622
01:06:04,398 --> 01:06:06,219
You're all alive.

623
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:10,760
The Matrix has gone.

624
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:14,241
And with it, all hope.

625
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:15,241
No!

626
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:16,762
Galvatron has it.

627
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:18,182
Where's Galvatron?

628
01:06:18,222 --> 01:06:18,702
Where is he?

629
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:20,963
And the answer is...

630
01:06:22,265 --> 01:06:23,286
Unicron!

631
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:25,607
Then we've got to destroy Unicron!

632
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:26,687
Yes, friends!

633
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:27,367
Act now!

634
01:06:27,407 --> 01:06:28,468
Destroy Unicron!

635
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:29,969
Kill the Grand Bullseye!

636
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:32,950
Eliminate even the toughest stains!

637
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:34,611
No fuss, no mess!

638
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:35,891
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

639
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:36,812
Sail must end!

640
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:40,253
Rush right on down and test drive ladies' model with no obligation!

641
01:06:41,454 --> 01:06:46,416
New improved junkie on planet Isley Sexy Import with Turbo Handling!

642
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,227
Unicron!

643
01:07:20,524 --> 01:07:21,304
Unicron!

644
01:07:21,665 --> 01:07:22,525
Answer me!

645
01:07:23,025 --> 01:07:23,765
See this!

646
01:07:24,266 --> 01:07:25,206
The Matrix!

647
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:29,648
I now possess that which you most fear!

648
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:36,531
You'll do my bidding, or taste my wrath!

649
01:07:42,674 --> 01:07:45,015
You underestimate me, Galvatron.

650
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:41,285
For a time, I considered sparing your wretched little planet Cybertron.

651
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:47,068
But now, you shall witness its dismemberment.

652
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:47,248
No!

653
01:08:47,629 --> 01:08:50,590
Decepticons!

654
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:51,711
We're under attack!

655
01:08:51,731 --> 01:08:52,531
Scramble!

656
01:09:41,605 --> 01:09:42,905
I don't believe it.

657
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:45,266
Doesn't this remind you of anything, Cup?

658
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:45,826
Nope.

659
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:48,866
Never seen anything like this before.

660
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:50,627
What happened to Moonbase 2?

661
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,171
Where's my dad?

662
01:09:54,011 --> 01:09:55,233
That's what we're gonna find out.

663
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:04,060
That did it, Apple.

664
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,543
This is fire, rain and corrosion for up to five years.

665
01:10:07,963 --> 01:10:09,564
Satisfaction guaranteed.

666
01:10:39,329 --> 01:10:40,210
Where's Hot Rod?

667
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,352
I don't know, but I hope they didn't get him.

668
01:10:45,414 --> 01:10:46,234
Quick, this way.

669
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,681
The Matrix!

670
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:28,982
It will do you no good, Autobot.

671
01:11:29,442 --> 01:11:30,542
It cannot be opened.

672
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:33,124
Not by a Decepticon.

673
01:11:33,824 --> 01:11:37,686
Like it or not, we are allies now, against a common foe.

674
01:11:45,251 --> 01:11:46,612
That will be obliterated.

675
01:11:47,053 --> 01:12:00,043
Of course, my master!

676
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:06,007
Puny Autobot!

677
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:09,110
You lack even Prime's courage!

678
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:27,027
Me Grimlock kick butt!

679
01:12:28,308 --> 01:12:33,390
Me Grimlock need new strategy!

680
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:02,316
Daniel!

681
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,441
Daniel!

682
01:14:04,002 --> 01:14:05,523
Dad, what can I do?

683
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:07,525
Knock down the acid cover!

684
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:08,566
How?

685
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:10,148
Blast it, son!

686
01:14:10,428 --> 01:14:11,690
But I don't have a gun!

687
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,051
Use your exosuit!

688
01:14:32,771 --> 01:14:33,292
Daniel!

689
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:34,993
You did it!

690
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:36,135
Yeah!

691
01:14:36,575 --> 01:14:37,356
I did it!

692
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,881
Come out, Autobot.

693
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:45,984
We all must die sometime.

694
01:14:46,665 --> 01:14:48,287
Not today, Galvatron.

695
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:13,192
I will crush you with my bare hands!

696
01:15:53,036 --> 01:15:54,617
First, Prime.

697
01:15:55,778 --> 01:15:57,239
Then, Ultra Magnus.

698
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,661
And now, you.

699
01:16:00,782 --> 01:16:07,947
It's a pity you Autobots die so easily, or I might have a sense of satisfaction now.

700
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:14,251
You got the touch!

701
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:17,694
You got the... Arise, Linus Prime.

702
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:36,337
This is the end of the road, Galvatron.

703
01:16:37,437 --> 01:16:40,458
Now, light our darkest hour.

704
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:47,208
Spike, Daniel!

705
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,268
Springer, what's going on?

706
01:17:49,588 --> 01:17:50,989
No time to answer that now.

707
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:52,049
Let's get out of here!

708
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:53,510
Look!

709
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:58,631
Autobots, transform and roll out!

710
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:14,462
I knew you had potential.

711
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:42,463
Destiny.

712
01:18:43,224 --> 01:18:49,294
You cannot destroy my destiny!

713
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:09,744
Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian Wars as we march forward to a new age of peace and happiness.

714
01:19:10,264 --> 01:19:11,645
Till all are one!

715
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:12,865
Till all are one!

716
01:19:12,885 --> 01:19:13,845
Till all are one!

717
01:19:15,146 --> 01:19:16,846
Till all are one!

718
01:19:21,108 --> 01:19:22,028
You got the time!

719
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:22,929
Till all are one!

720
01:19:22,949 --> 01:19:23,349
You got the power!

721
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:04,744
We've had a strike, there'll be no place to run When you come within the grill

722
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:45,465
Robots in the sky Long enough to break the bravest part So we have to pull together No, we can't stay worth the part To stand in line if we was born in war Until our darkest hour

723
01:21:04,876 --> 01:21:11,938
All of us wage their battle to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons

724
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:24,685
Coming from the sky above And there's nothing you can do We've had a strike, there'll be no place to run When you come within the grill

725
01:22:38,573 --> 01:22:53,323
Robots in disguise Long enough to break the blade apart So we have to pull together No, we can't stay worlds apart To stand in line if we were strong enough Until our darkest hour

726
